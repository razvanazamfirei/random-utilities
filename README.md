# Random Utilities

This repository contains small utilities I've written to avoid having to rewrite code. All the utilities can be installed by the following commands:
```
net from https://razvanazamfirei.github.io/random-utilities
net install [packagename]
```
## AKI Stage assignment (aki_ra) 
Assigns AKI Stage based on the KDIGO guidelines. 

## Destring Error (destringerror_ra)
Finds values that prevent clean destringing.

### Remarks
There is virtually no suport provided for those commands. If they work for you, great! If not, feel free to initiate a pull request or just write your own.
