# Stata Commands
This repository contains Stata commands I've written to make my life easier. All the utilities can be installed with the following:

net from https://azamfirei.com/utilities
net install [packagename]

Remarks
I make no warranties about any of those commands. They are here mostly for my personal use. If they work for you, great! Please let me know if there's a bug, or feel free to initiate a pull request. I'm unlikely to implement feature requests, but if you feel strongly you can ask or just fork the repository.
