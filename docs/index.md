# Stata Commands

This repository contains Stata commands I've written to make my life easier. All the utilities can be installed with the following:
```
net from https://azamfirei.com/utilities
net install [packagename]
```
Here is a brief description of each of the available commands. For more information, please see the appropriate documentation page.


- **aki_ra** - Assigns AKI Stages based on the KDIGO guidelines.

- **destringerror_ra** - Identifies values that prevent clean destringing.

- **datefix_ra** - Reformats all date/datetime variables to a consistent format.

- **zanthro** - This is essentially a rehost of a Stata Journal Package (sj_****). I have not written this.

In progress:

- Project set-up package.
- Randomization modules.

### Remarks
I make no warranties about any of those commands. They are here mostly for my personal use. If they work for you, great! Please let me know if there's a bug, or feel free to initiate a pull request. I'm unlikely to implement feature requests, but if you feel strongly you can ask or just fork the repository.
